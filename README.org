* OT Puzzles

  This library contains a reference to some of the OT puzzles which we
  encounter at Spatch.

** Building

   The raw document is =puzzles.org=. It can be exported to a tex/pdf
   doc by calling =org-latex-export-to-pdf= on it from Emacs.

** Releases

   The tex and pdf files are included in the releases.

** Future

   - The org+emacs dependency is heavy. Alternatively, the source
     could be the .tex file.
